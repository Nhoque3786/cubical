# Cubical: Kinda like a FEZ spiritual sucessor, made on godot. (Or some thing like that)
This dumb project is for a game i'm making for learning how to make games and 100% pure for the love i have for the concept the original game has. 

**(NOTE: THIS PAGE CAN BE AND WILL BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO HOW THE PROJECT GOES.)**

## Idea
You are Cubic, a little cuboid on a dimension full of the same species. After you discovered acidentally a temple about a shape you didint seem before (that coincidentally it's the shape that forms, you!), you acidentally become a "hero" of some kind of proffecy about saving the dimension cluster you are. To save the dimension cluster, you collect Bits and Bytes and figure stuff out using the "power" you aquired of *literal bending the camera*.

## Where does this start?
Go to [Prototype Edition](Wiki/prototype.md) for more info. I'm adding more pages to the wiki folder when i'm adding new scripts, stuff and shit.

## What will be on the full game? (if this become a full game)
- 8 Dimensions. About *64 bytes* for each one (32 positive, 32 negative), in total of LITERALLY 512 BYTES ON TOTAL!
- Secrets! 
- Mind-bending mechanics. Familiar ones, and new ones.
- 2 Endings!
- Hats!
- Maybe some boss levels? (no enemies included.)
- and other shit i'm thinking. 

## What will NOT be in the full game?
- Enemies and Life system (It dosent make sense adding them.)
- Overcomplicated UI.
- Shop system (communist moment lol)

## What i'm using for making this?
Mostly, *Open Source* Software!
