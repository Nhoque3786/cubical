# Prototype Edition!
Before doing the entire project (which will take years, since it's a really big and ambicious project i'm doing just to learn and also continue a legacy of a game i really like), i'm doing a prototype edition! This will be a web game edition playable on Newgrounds (why newgrounds? because i like that place lol), showing the idea, experimenting and having feedback about it. Also i need to ask folks at Polytron if i can make this a full game without going into some type of legal shit or something like that. (Probably they will just say "okay" lol)

The prototype will be like a little demo at it's core. First for quick testing, ideas and shit basically.

## What will be on the prototype? 
### This also counts as a mini todo for me to grasp what i'm doing at the moment.
